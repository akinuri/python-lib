# CSS Merger

Merges multiple CSS files into a single file.

Also does the following operations:

* removes blank lines
* removes single line comments
* removes multiple line comments
* removes inline comments

To-do:

* remove unnecessary whitespace (if we're packing, we might as well get rid of them)
