不 不 你不会有问题的
No, no, not you

147
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,840
该死的流体静力平衡学 完全没意义
It's the stupid hydrostatic equilibrium. It doesn't make sense!

148
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,010
这是很难很难很难 但是别灰心
It is awfully difficult. But don't despair.

149
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:29,920

为估算太阳中心的压强
To estimate the pressure at the centre of the sun,

152
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,690
只需假设其恒定密度为1.41克每立方厘米
just assume a constant density of 1.41 grams per cubic cm.

153
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,610
我是不是说太快了啊
Am I going too fast for you?

154
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,290
Herkabe是为了羞辱我才让你指导我的
You know, Herkabe only made you my tutor to humiliate me.

155
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,030
我还以为是为了羞辱我呢
I thought it was to humiliate me.

156
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,840
我就不懂了 这鬼东西怎么这么难
I don't understand why is this so hard?!

157
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,130
别放弃 还记得<勇敢的小货车>吗
Don't give up. Remember The Little Engine That Could?

158
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,510
你根本没明白
You're not listening!

159
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,120
我什么都知道
I get everything!

160
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,250
我这辈子就没有什么东西学不会的
In my entire life, there is nothing I haven't been able to master.

161
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,020
我六年级就学了代数学
I took algebra in 6th grade!

162
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,560
我五岁时就教会我爸怎么重组变速器
I taught my dad how to rebuilt his transmission when I was five!

163

我会走之前就识字了
I was reading before I could walk!

164
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,230
- 我记得我自己出生的过程  - 什么
I remember my own birth. What?!

165
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,960
你知道你妈子宫收缩的时候你的心跳会停止吗
D'you know your heart stops during your mother's contractions?

166
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,610
你真记得那些吗
You seriously remember that?

167
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,480
最糟糕的是换尿片
Worst was the diaper changing.

168
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,980
那是我这辈子活得最没尊严的一周
That was the most degrading week of my life.

169
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,860
那么 你那里面是什么情况
So, what's it like in there?

170
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,820
什么意思
What do you mean?

171
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,020
你大脑里
Well, your brain?

172
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,660
对我而言 当我思考太用力的时候
I mean, for me it's like, when I'm thinking really hard,

173
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,760
我大脑里开始各种联想
my brain starts making all these connections.

174
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,670
层出不穷的联想
Those connections make other connections,

175
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,940
感觉计算速度飞快
Everything starts to moving really fast.

176
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,060
接着大脑就像要爆炸了似的
Then it feels like a bomb's going off.

177
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,730
你也这样吗
Is yours like that?

178
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,450
我的大脑更像个蜂箱
It's more like a beehive.

179
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,120
里面每只蜜蜂都有个像你一样的大脑
And every bee has a brain like yours.

180
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,860
准备好了
OK, ready!

181
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,650
帅爆了
That is so cool!

182
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,500
要是有支枪就好了
I wish you had a gun

183
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,160
那我们就能真正测试这个玻璃的性能了
so we can really test this out.

184
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,520
不好意思 点单
Excuse me. Can I get some help here?

185
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,530
嗨 Greg
Hi, Greg.

186
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,880
我无意中听到你妈讲电话
So I overheard your mom talking on the phone

187
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,890
你还真在这上班啊
and it's true. You've got a job.

188
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,800
我申请过这里的工作 可惜没拿到
I applied here once. Didn't get it.

189
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,740
- 都怪政治  - 可能吧
- It's all politics. - I guess.

190
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,140
- 你要点什么  - 仔细听好
- So what do you want? - I want you to listen very carefully.

191
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,700
我现在血糖指标已经非常低了
My blood sugar's dangerously low

192
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,250
我不想再劳神费心给你说第二遍
so I don't wanna burn up calories repeating myself.

193
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,360
我要一个巨无霸汉堡配大份薯条
I want the jumbo clown burger with big top fries,

194
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,490
不要腌黄瓜 一片洋葱 只要中间部分
no pickles, a slice of onion, make sure it's centre cut,

195
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,910
还有多放西红柿
and extra tomatoes.

196
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,840
肉饼要一面全熟 一面五分熟
And let's do the pattie well on one side, medium on the other.

197
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,280
汉堡胚要新做的
Make sure they open a fresh package for my bun.

198
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,840
不新鲜的话 我就走人
If it's stale I bail.

199
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,830
说真的
Seriously.

200
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,820
总共5块4毛5 可乐还可免费续杯
Your total's $5.45 and you get free refills on the soda.

201
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,420
早就知道了 不过仅限今天
Heard that one before. Turns out it's just for today.

202
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,960
混球
What a sack!

203
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,900
这可是揩零的大好机会啊
That's a pocket transaction if I ever saw one.

204
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,430
哦 是的
Oh, yeah. Right.

205
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,100
Artie 你这个单身派对办得太完美了
Artie, you put together one hell of a bachelor party.

206
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,560
我很感谢你
I'm much obliged to you.

207
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,100
就是对不住大家 最近的脱衣舞女在300英里外
I'm just sorry the nearest stripper's 300 miles away.

208
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,240
嘿 她现在怎么样了啊
Hey, how's she doin' anyway?

209
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,320
她刚把上衣全脱了
She took her top off!

210
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,380
噢耶
Oh, yeah!

211
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,330
各位 听我说几句
Listen up! I'd like to say a few words about my mate Pete,

212
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,240
我的老朋友Pete就要结婚了
on account of his upcoming nuptials.

213
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,620
多少次我情绪低落时
Many's the time, when I've been feeling low,

214
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,290
我都知道我总还有Pete
and I always knew I could turn to Pete.

215
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,870
他就这样躺在他的床上 用打火机修胡子
He'd be lying on his bunk, trimming his beard with a lighter,

216
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,740
我就会想 "妈的 我总比他这样强"
and I'd think, "Hell, I'm better than that."

217
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,600
敬Pete和他幸运的新娘
To Pete and his lucky lady!

218
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,010
你怎么回事啊
What's going on with you?

219
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,620
我就是不知道我们都在庆祝什么
I just don't get what are we celebrating?

220
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,060
总感觉不对
I mean, it just seems wrong.

221
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,840
这是Pete的生活
It's Pete's life.

222
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,080
他要想娶一个陌生人 那是他的事
If he wants to marry a total stranger, that's his business.

223
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,490
那新娘怎么办 有谁想过她
What about this woman? Is anyone thinking about her?

224
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,920
我现在只想想着这个没穿上衣的脱衣舞女
Right now I'm trying to keep a topless stripper in my head.

225
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,620
实在没心思想别的了
I don't have room for much else.

226
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,900
想想看
Think about it for a second.

227
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,010
她就这样盲目地许下一个承诺
She's blindly committing

228
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,680
把余生荒废在这个鬼地方
to spend her life in this god forsaking place

229
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,350
还要做Pete的老婆
with Pete as her husband.

230
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,710
这得是有多可怜才能落到这种下场啊
What kind of poor creature would actually go through with this?

231
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,230
说不定她现在的生活也很糟糕呢
Maybe her life's pretty awful.

232
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,420
比这还糟吗
Worse than this?

233
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,190
她是活在集中营么
What? Does she live in a slaughterhouse?

234
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,180
她是每天要被马拖着去上班么
Is she dragged to work by horses every day?

235
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,340
她完全不知道她要面临的是什么样的生活
She couldn't possibly know what she's getting into.

236
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,990
别夸大其词了 我们也不知道
You're exaggerating. We don't know.

237
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,460
最终结果没准还不错呢
It might work out fine.

238
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,060
兄弟 生意怎么样啊
Dude, how's business?

239
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,340
你去哪了 我本该回家吃晚饭了
Where were you? I was supposed to be home for dinner

240
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,240
可没你我还下不了班
but you are the only one who can cash me out.

241
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,520
我要是你的话 还是乖一点
Hey, I'd stay on my good side if I was you.

242
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,890
就这几天 有人要打扫卫生间了哟
One of these days somebody'll have to clean these bathrooms.

243
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,320
哇 太不像话了
Whoa, this is way uncool.

244
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
Reese 你可不能一下拿这么多钱啊
Reese, you can't take this much money.

245
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,200
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

246
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,250
收银机 瞧 少了400块
Your cash drawer, man.. It is over $400 bucks short. Look.

247
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,520
揩零的精髓就在于拿个5块10块就行了
The whole point is to take five or ten bucks. That's it.

248
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,250
你得把那400块放回来
You got to put the 400 back.

249
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,680
我没拿 真没拿
I didn't take it. Honest.

250
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,130
兄弟 这可是你的收银机
Dude. It's your register.

251
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,510
- 他今天把钥匙给别人了吗  - 没给
- Did he give his register key to anyone today? - No.

252
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,560
我没拿钱 我什么都没拿
I didn't take it. I didn't take any.

253
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,340
我连一次揩零都没揩
I never even do one of those stupid pocket transactions.

254
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,560
你说什么呢 我昨天还看你拿了呢
What do you talking about? I saw you yesterday.

255
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,470
没 我只是装装样子 其实我没拿
No, I wanted it to look like I was taking it. But I didn't really.

256
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,450
我趁你们没注意的时候把钱放回去了
When you guys weren't looking I put the money back.

257
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,200
你们都没看到 我是偷偷地放进去的
You guys didn't see it cos I was being... sneaky and stuff.

258
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,130
不错嘛 Reese
Nice, Reese.

259
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,790
- 谢谢你全家  - 我没拿
- Way to screw it up for everybody. - I didn't take it!

260
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,450
听着 这事如果你想着我会罩你 你就别指望了
Look, man. If you are thinking that I'm coverin' for you, you are crazy.

261
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,500
店老板明天早上来检查账目的时候
When the owner comes back tomorrow morning and checks the books,

262
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,280
这钱最好得在这 要不然你麻烦可就大了
that money better be herel, or you're going down.

263
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,860
星等是衡量天体光度的量
在全光谱范围内由视星等转换到绝对星等
Alright. The change from apparent to absolute magnitude in all spectra

264
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,130
转换方程为
The formula is...

265
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:35,230
A与B的比值乘以K与D的比值 如果K是
A over B times K over D. That's if K is...

266
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,110
这么多公式怎么记得住啊
How do they expect you to learn all these formulas?

267
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,670
用点记忆技巧
Use a mnemonic device,

268
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,880
比如说Enephru Babashar Kalar Dastrer
like Enephru, Babashar, Kalar, Dastrer.

269
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,620
都是巴比伦第三王朝的国王
Babylonian kings, Third Dynasty.

270

271
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,710

There is $400 missing from my register during my shift,

275
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,010
他们以为是我拿了
and they think I took it.

276
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,850
- 那是你拿的吗  - 当然不是
- Well, did you? - No, of course not!

277
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,770
- 我是Barton  - 这个小矮子是谁啊
- I'm Barton. - Who's this dork?

278
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,570
- 他是我的家教  - 我靠
- He is my tutor. - You're kiddin' me!

279
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,230
我就这么一次需要你的天才智慧
The one time I need you to be a genius

280
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,240
结果发现你是个冒牌货
I find you've been faking the whole smart thing.

281
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,220
Reese 冷静点 事情怎么会这样呢
Reese, calm down. How did this happen?

282
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,010
我也不知道
I don't know.

283
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,560
交班的时候我收银机里的钱对不上账了
My register didn't total up right at the end of the shift.

284
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,940

285
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,930

Barton 想不想见识一下真实世界

Dewey 给我们打个掩护
Dewey, you have to cover it for us.

295
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,790
让爸妈感觉我们一直都在
Make sure it sounds like we're all still here.

宠物店老板跟我说这鱼已经死了
Pet store owner told me it was already dead,

303
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,390
但我感觉情况更糟
but I suspect the worst.

304
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,300
好的 我们今晚趁Dewey睡着了就把鱼掉包
OK. Let's switch the fish tonight when Dewey's sleeping.

305
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,770
我不知道 Lois 总感觉很卑鄙
I don't know, Lois. It seems so sneaky and underhanded.

306
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,800
我们这是要给孩子们树立怎样的榜样啊
What kind of example are we setting for the boys?

307
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,250
Hal 别担心
Well, Hal, stop worrying.

兄弟 弄到钱了吗

Yeah, you'd like another 400, wouldn't you?

311
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,680
你什么意思啊你
What are you talking about?

312
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,300
哇 一整套寄生系统群落呢
Wow! An entire colony of parasitica.

313
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,920
一边吃披萨去 Dewey
Get your own pizza, Dewey.

314
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,060
他不叫Dewey
His name's not Dewey.

315
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,180
那这些年你们让我叫他Dewey干嘛
How come you had me call him that all these years?

316
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,940
听着 我们知道你拿了那笔钱
Look. We know you took the money

317
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,620
还想栽赃给Reese
and you're trying to pin it on Reese.

318
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,510
你个白眼狼 我哥给你帮了多少忙啊
After everything my brother's done for you!

319
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,440
给你做不在场证明 帮你发传单
All the alibis, all the handouts,

320
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,380
- 还一直帮你装死  - 兄弟
- all the times he's helped you fake your death! - Whoa! Dudes!

321
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,970
我今天都没在店里
I wasn't even there today.

322
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,400
我就在交接的时候去了一趟
The only time I came in was to cash out.

323
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,110
你当时也在场
You were right there.

324
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,490
是这样 但是我四点半的时候休息了十分钟
Yeah, but I had a ten-minute break at 4:30.

325
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,510
你可以趁机溜进去偷钱
You could have snuck in then and take the money.

326
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,930
- 是的 但  - 你想装无辜
- Yeah, but... - You wanna play innocent?

327
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,900
好 我们让警察来决定
Fine. We'll just let the police decide.

328
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,740
叫警察啊
Whoa, police.!

329
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,350
你凭什么认为条子会站在你那边
What makes you think the cops are gonna take your side?

330
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,240
可能因为你已经犯了十多次盗窃罪
Maybe cos you've been arrested like 10 times for petty theft.

331
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,820
不好意思 有一次是因为纵火
Excuse me, one of those was for arson.

332
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,780
我跟你讲 你犯了个大错
I am telling you, you're making a big mistake.

333
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,330
- 才没有  - 就有
- No, I'm not! - Yes, you are!

334
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,460
- 就没有  - 你确实错了
- No, I'm not! - Yes, you are.

335
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,280
他没偷那笔钱 照这张传票来看

四点二十的时候Richie在威尔逊18号
Richie was stopped at 4:20 at 18th and Wilson

337
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,040
因行车小便被警察拦了下来
for urinating from a moving vehicle.

338
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,050
- 然后呢  - 马戏团汉堡店在沃纳特
- So? - So the Circus Burger is on Walnut,

339
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,160
两地相隔至少有25英里
which is at least 25 miles away.

340
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,120
他不可能在Reese休息的时候赶到的
He couldn't have got there during Reese's break.

341
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,380
如果路上不堵
Well what if the traffic was light..

342
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,200
而且一辆78年的博纳维尔可以开到300英里每小时
Yeah. And maybe if a '78 Bonneville could go 300 miles an hour.

343
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,110
否则的话不可能
Otherwise, it's impossible.

344
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,070
嘿 不错嘛 Dewey
Hey, way to go, Dewey!

345
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,060
- 让我看看这个  - 他是对的吗

346
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,400
是的 他永远是对的
Yes. He's always right.

347
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,360
不好意思 Richie 我们走吧 Reese
Sorry, Richie. Come on, Reese, let's go.

348
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,110
但是我发誓没有拿那钱啊 我没拿啊
But I swear to God, I didn't do it. I didn't take the money!

349
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,530
别急 我们还有几个小时
Well, look. We still have a few hours.

350
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,180
或许我们可以想个
Maybe we can figure...

351
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,050
Richie 我买到这个DVD播放器了
Richie, I got us this DVD player

352
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,990
但是我们还要 再去偷个600块
but we need to steal another 600

353
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,090
如果你想要环绕立体声
if you want the surround...

354
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,780
音响的话
..sound.

355
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,310
估计你得留好收据
You may wanna hang on to that receipt.

356
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,150
你居然对我们说谎了
I can't believe you lied!

357
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,360
我要报警
We are calling the cops!

358
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,420
嘿 嘿 嘿 或许我们可以私了
Hey-ey-ey. Maybe we could figure out some sort of a deal?

我可以跟你女朋友亲热亲热
I get to make out with your girlfriend.

363
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,680
想都别想
Forget it!

364
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,430
好吧 那我要这个泡泡椅
Alright, the bean bag chair.

365
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,340

Eric and Artie should be back any minute with your bride.

369
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,420
老实说 我 我有点儿紧张
I gotta to be honest, I'm er... I'm a little nervous.

370
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,220
你就要娶一个完全陌生的人为妻
You are about to marry a total stranger.

371
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,170
你有没有认真想过你这是要干什么
Have you really thought about what you're doing?

372
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,650
我很早以前就想过要安定下来了
I've been thinking about settling down for a long long time.

373
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,860
可是你对她什么都不了解啊
But you don't know anything about her.

374
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,240
要是她认为你
What if she thinks you're...

375
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,130
要是她不喜欢你怎么办
What if she doesn't like you?

376
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,840
我会很伤心
I'd be sad

377
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,420
但无论如何我都保证会支持她
but I'd reassure her I'd support her anyway,

378

我将用尽余生呵护她
Then I guess I'd spend the rest of my life being sweet to her.

380
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,130
顺便改变一下她的看法
And also changing her mind.

381

390
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,440
- 为什么是你来  - 因为是我签收的
- Why you? Cos I signed for it!

391
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,060
你签收的又怎么样 等下
Who cares if you signed for it? Wait a minute.

392

Richie可真是个好人啊 还接你们去上学
How nice of Richie to drive you to school.

是的 是的 很好
Yeah, yeah. Great.

401
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,190
这个小妖精
That little monster!

402
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,880
他一直都在自个买鱼来换
He's been buying his own fish and switchin' 'em!

403
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,120
天知道他买了几个
God only knows how many he's gone through.

404
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,780
- 为此他得付出代价  - 怎么付
- He's gonna pay for this! - How?

405
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,120
我们要是揭穿他 他得知道我们也在作弊了
If we bust him, he'll know we've been cheating, too.

406
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,980
Dewey 我们很自豪
Dewey, your father and I are so proud of

407
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,830
你能把这条鱼照顾得这么好
the way you've taken care of that fish.

408
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,950
是的 你完全证明了你值得我们的信任
Yes, we are. You certainly proved to us you can be trusted.

409
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,070
我们很高兴有你这样
It's so nice to have a boy

410
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,370
认真谨慎 负责任
who's so conscientious, responsible

411
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,070
诚实 永不犯错的儿子
and honest and who always finds a way to do the right thing.

412
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,860
接下来 你有什么话要跟我们说吗
Before we go any further, is there anything you wanna tell me?

413
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,310
我想要个毕尔格猎犬
I want a beagle!

414
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,920
想都别想了 你个小骗子
You're not gonna get it, you little sneak!

415
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,080
我们已经知道了你一直都在换死鱼
We know that you've been switching fish on us,

416
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,360
我昨晚放的那条死鱼今天就被你换成活的了
and that's because I put a dead fish in there last night!

417
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,390
你们作弊 你们都是大骗子
That's cheating! You're cheaters!

418
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:28,400
虽然是用的土办法教育他
It's not exactly textbook

419
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,240
但是至少我们不用养狗了
but at least we're not getting a dog.

420
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,020
我清理好了我的桌子
I cleaned out my cubby.

421
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,770
你真的不能留下来吗
You're sure I can't talk you into staying?

422
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,990
我妈妈说我需要个健康点的环境
Mom says I need a healthier environment.

423
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,420
她觉得你为了你自己的野心
She thinks it's creepy the way you're using me

424
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,280
利用我有点变态
for your own self-grandiosement.

425
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,340
你根本不需要健康一点的环境
A healthier environment? That's not what you need.

426
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,790
你不可能跟其他普通人进行正常交流
Son, you'll never connect normally with another human being.

427
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,830
他们会觉得你过于天才而嫉妒排挤你
People will recognise your brilliance and loathe you for it.

428
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,750
你能得到的最好结果就是无以名状的恐惧
The best you can hope for is uncomprehending fear
