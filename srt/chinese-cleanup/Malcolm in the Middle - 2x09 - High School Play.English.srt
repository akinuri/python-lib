1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,110
I am home

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,110
Hi honey

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,090
we are on our own tonight,I thought maybe we go out to dineer

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,540
Where are the kids?

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,280
Malcolm is over Stevie's Reese's got a hockey practice

6
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,910
Dewey's at Billy's or one of the neighborhood kids

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,160
So we are on our own

8
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,080
What do you in the mood for?

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,980
That is gotta be a new record

10
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,320
people are always asking our class to volunteer for stuff

11
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,550
They just assume we are social rejects with nothing better to do

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,030
And it's true

13
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,010
I just don't like any thrown on my face

14
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,670
So our school needs a kid about your age to be in our school play

15
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,670
We are a lot of fun!

16
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,640
The play is by a guy named William Shakespeare

17
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,910
He was a writer way back in olden times

18
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,840
He was a syphilitic drunk fronting

19
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,580
for the 14th Earl of Oxford

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,250
Why can not you leave the part alone!

21
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,920
So he didn't have the benefit of higher education

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,390
How many Phd is the great King Lear

23
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,980
now now try to remember we have a guest

24
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,460
Let's save our heated words for our open forum Friday

25
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,130
Megan continue

26
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,350
Whoever he was

27
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,830
He had a pointed litter beard

28
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,810
and he wrote a really good play called "MidSummer Nights Dream"

29
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,170
We need someone to play the changeling boy

30
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,670
Okay before anyone gets too excited there is a downside

31
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,840
- you'll probablely have to miss class - I will do it!

32
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,960
He can't! We were working on a secret project that

33
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,040
I've said too much

34
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,450
Okay, I thought we agree, no more secret projects

35
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,860
Some of you still don't have your eyebrows back from your last secret project

36
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,750
- I can do both - All right

37
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,260
Just as long as you know your where your priorities are

38
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,310
I can go now

39
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,890
I used to think she was so

40
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,740
boring but after she's bi-curious she's just so much I don't know cooler

41
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,840
Oh my God! That is so true!

42
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,170
She's like totally changed the personalities she's been wheat

43
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,010
Oh, and have you heard?

44
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,120
Mark is totally out of that swing thing which is so over, and into goth...

45
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,660
oh! <On the road>

46
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,360
I read that That's really a good book

47
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,300
That's Travis. He has angst

48
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,360
Look at all these people!

49
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,500
They are pierced.They are brooding.They are wearing wired clothes

50
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,390
They don't care about anything!

51
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,540
It's like a room full of Francises

52
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,180
Okay, people!

53
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,770
We are doing the Act 3 scene 2

54
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,350
Oberon, Puck

55
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,570
- Where's My Puck? - I think he has a wrestling meet.

56
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,820
Hey, you!

57
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,820
Changeling boy

58
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,700
- Can you read? - Yeah

59
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,520
we gotta half these kids beat

60
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,720
Read Puck for the day page 27

61
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,320
This is thy negligence:

62
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,430
still thou mistakest

63
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,510
Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully

64
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,330
Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook

65
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,030
Did not you tell me I should know

66
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,390
The man by the Athenian garment be had on?

67
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,910
And so far blameless proves my enterprise,

68
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,810
That I have nointed an Athenian's eyes and so far

69
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,880
You went from a part

70
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,580
with no lines to the lead in a high school play?

71
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,710
That's great! That's not musical is it?

72
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,060
- No - That's great!

73
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,240
Dude you play a fairy!

74
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,630
Not just any fairy Reese! He's the biggest fairy in a whole play!

75
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,630
I'm so proud of you

76
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,890
rehearsals are every night. You have to get me there by 5

77
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:02,930
Every night?

78
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,220
oh, yeah we build sets on the weekends

79
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,650
Okay we can do this

80
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,930
if I go to work early I can get off in enough time to drop you off at rehearsals

81
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,340
before I take Reese to hockey

82
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,010
except the days Reese is detention

83
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,230
And then Dewey is home alone

84
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,250
I'll it take care of it, I can rearrange my schedule for a couple of weeks

85
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,300
It'll be fun spending some time together

86
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,690
Can we run over things the car like we did last time?

87
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,170
It was already dead

88
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,980
This is your best guacamole yet, Joe

89
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,980
Thanks

90
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,130
The secret is fresh lime juice

91
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,520
Commander on the floor

92
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,460
no, please. Don't let me disturb you

93
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,100
make yourselves at home

94
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,380
Wait a minute

95
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,400
This is not your home

96
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,750
This is not your Mama's house

97
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,600
There is no maid here to clean up your toys

98
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,640
And yet, I look around this institution of learning

99
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,020
I see video games. I see girlie magazines

100
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,440
and I see Garth

101
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,030

102
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,020
Garf Vader, defiling our Wall of remebering

103
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,080
Garf Vader, defiling our Wall of remebering

104
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,500
Well clearly things have got a little lax around here

105
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,580
I blame myself, but it is you who will suffer

106
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,450
From now on there will be weekly inspections

107
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,710
and you will relinquish all nonstandard-issue personal

108
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,590
affects and artwork

109
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,070
It's time for you to learn that true happiness comes from within

110
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,620
So why you are so happy sir?

111
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,050
I'm as giddy as a Schoolgirl, Cadet

112
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,080
Okay， get each other cleaner, glitter for Malcolm's costume

113
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,360
I think that's it

114
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,110
Oh my god! Is that right?

115
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,240
- What time do you have? - 5:45

116
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,250
5:45
5:45

117
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,130
That's not possible I

118
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,240
Dropped off Malcolm, picked up Reese. Dinner is in the oven

119
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,830
What is it?

120
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,960
I have the next 25 minutes free

121
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,100
How did you manage that? Did you leave a kid somewhere?

122
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,640
no. They are all accounted for

123
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,150
- What do you gonna do? - I don't know

124
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,720
I don't know

125
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,770
- So this goes here? - Yeah, that should do it

126
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,250
hey, these were in English

127
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,110
this is nice, never looks like the box when I do it alone

128
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,890
Me either

129
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,950
We make a good team

130
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,170
All right, you start on the main street I'll do university place.

131
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,640
we'll meet in the bistro say noon-ish

132
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,610
- Would you like a massage? - I Don't know

133
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,920
- I'm really not a massage person - It only takes 15 minutes

134
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,630
Well

135
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,760
I do have some to time to kill

136
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,860
I am not taking off my shirt

137
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,120
and I am warning you, I never been hypnotized and I never been relaxed

138
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,400
actually feels

139
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,840
feels

140
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,450
pretty good

141
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,740
Pleading for a lover's fee

142
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,200
Shall we their fond pageant see

143
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,410
Lord, what fools these mortals be

144
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,640
I'm very upset with you Malcolm

145
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,100
You made me care again

146
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,020
- Malcolm that was terrific! - God I give anything to be as good as you!

147
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,250
And if you are this good now

148
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,310
imagining how amazing you're gonna be when you are 15

149
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,200
and think how cute he's gonna be when he is 15

150
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,010
oh my god, did I just giggle?

151
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,000
Did you just giggle

152
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,180
"Stevie, what are you doing here?

153
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,290
You missed the meeting

154
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,280
You jeopardize

155
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,370
ing

156
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,140
our project

157
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,490
Great, see you in class

158
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,530
I wonder if I could just go straight  to high school?

159
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,440
I've been told skipping grades stunts you socially

160
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,690
but I think I've been lied to

161
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,490
But sir, that's a photo of my sister!

162
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,540
To you she is your sister. to the others cadets, she is a distraction

163
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,880
Now, if you need me to go into more detail on that. I will

164
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,620
How long are those sideburns Cadet?

165
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,160
This is crazy!

166
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,550
Even prisoners can have photographs

167
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,630
Spangler trying to take away the things that remind us we're still human

168
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,700
Francis, don't rock the boat

169
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,980
I don't care anymore

170
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,820
It's time to take last desperate stand for individualality and freedom

171
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,360
Malcolm, Reese. Get a move on

172
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,020
Oh good god Hal! When do you gonna clean this up?

173
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,650
Malcolm Reese, let's go!

174
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,760
Honey, I promised Dewey I'd spend time with him

175
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,630
This must have cost a fortune!

176
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,710
We'll talk about this later

177
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,280
Some of us have places to be!

178
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,110
So Dewey, I believe our little community can use a school

179
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,160
We don't need it, everyone borns smart

180
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,850
Oh, it's beautiful son. It's Utopia

181
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,830
and anyone stupid will be ground for food

182
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Ah

183
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,070
A cannibal utopia

184
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,070
Interesting

185
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,110
Oh you are still here?

186
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,860
I was just doing some shopping and

187
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,080
I thought, while I'm was here. You know

188
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,160
I step over and say hi

189
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,150
Oh, my god. How do you that?

190
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,310

191
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,040
this releases the mind

192
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,510
This releases the heart

193
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,910
And you know what this one does?

194
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,700
We need to talk

195
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,880
You missed our last 5 secret meetings

196
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,450
and our text run is in less than 20 minutes

197
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,210
Why do you hate us?

198
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,570
Guys, I don't hate you

199
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,270
I've just been really busy

200
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,620
We're still friends

201
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,510
- Really? - Of cause

202
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,130
So you are not bailing on the project?

203
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,160
- No! - Then you have the final figures!

204
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,470
Yeah, I worked on them all night after rehearsal they're on my desk

205
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,350
Here

206
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,850
It was the other kids who doubt you

207
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,640
Hey Malcolm. Need a ride?

208
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,080
I gotta go

209
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,210
She's distracted We have to do it now!

210
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,960
The program is running

211
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,500
Let's light this candle

212
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,260
Ignition

213
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,280
in

214
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,640
5
5

215
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,150
4
4

216
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,320
3
3

217
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,810
Blast off

218
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,550
It's trajectory seems rather peculiar

219
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,020
Okay, there are any number reasons  why that might have gone wrong.

220
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,110
Where is it?

221
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:35,650
I work hard too, but I manage to make it to Lamaze class

222
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,580
We had a vote

223
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,150
we want you get rid of the plant.

224
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,430
You can't get us all the troubles with this little sunny use

225
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,010
This isn't a stunt. This is an act of violence

226
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,240
It's a plant!

227
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,890
Can't you see. It isn't about a plant

228
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,950
It's about fighting tyranny fascist and oppression!

229
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,870
When Spangler sees this

230
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,560
He'll know he didn't crash our spirit and he never will

231
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,860
It's not worth the risk

232
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,980
Once again it seems like I'm the only man around here

233
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,210
I can't believe Nicole wearing dress like that

234
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,660
you can only see her nipple. If she wants to be a slut that's fine

235
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,650
- But don't make me lose my lunch - I know,

236
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,840
she's like totally trying to impress David

237
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,420
But the way he's off in Brenda's business she didn't have a chance

238
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,520
I can't believe how deep our conversations are getting

239
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,250
You never gonna believe what I heard about Josh. But you can't tell anyone

240
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,450
I overheard his stepsister

241
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,330
When I was in the bathroom - His half sister or step sister

242
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,640
No, his step sister. That's why he can  have a crush on her

243
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,520
- They were just talking about me weren't they? - No, we are talking about Josh

244
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,010
Oh my god! His father like totally went down

245
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,810
after catching him in the hot tub with his step sister

246
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,740
but you know what I don't even think he knows the whole story

247
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,670
That's my cue

248
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,620
I feel guilty having so much fun and at ditching the Krelboynes

249
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,520
but I'm sure they are doing fun without me

250
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,140
You boys just lucky no one call the police

251
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,510
You can't prove there's any correlation between our rocket exploding

252
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,760
and Caroline giving birth at the parking lot

253
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,450
She and the baby are fine. Thanks for asking

254
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,710
And

255
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,320
Rocket?

256
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,740
Oh god that is true

257
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,250
It's finished

258
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,180
A perfect society

259
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,450
We have done what 5 thousand years of so called civilization couldn't do

260
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,470
We create a world at works

261
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,180
we?

262
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,500
You wanna destroy it don't you?

263
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Yeah

264
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,050
Well I appreciate that you haven't

265
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,120
You've shown a lot of restraint

266
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,370
Here, Enjoy

267
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,610
Oh dear, I know we gotta a little carried away but this is it, I promise

268
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,590
- It's okay, I'm going grocery shopping - Did't you just go grocery shopping ?

269
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,560
Yeah sure, no problem

270
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,200
- Thank you - Where is Mr. Lee?

271
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,470
- Excuse me? - The massages guy, where is he?

272
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,670
Oh, he's not working here any more

273
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,200
What do you mean? That's impossible! He would never leave without telling me

274
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,600
Well I can trying to find out where he move to

275
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,760
so he can leave me again

276
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,320
Forget it!

277
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,780
it's over

278
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,990
I heard John has a new piercing

279
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,510
and I'll give you three guesses where and it's not ear or belly  belly

280
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,870
Julie would know, she went camp with one of her boyfriend with out town

281
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,090
John takes all the girl camping and he's trying to  convince them to go skinny-dipping

282
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,980
But I don't think John's naked will turn me up guys forever

283
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,800
You know, we should totally do

284
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,440
We should totally have a pool party night half on Saturday

285
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,910
- Malcolm want to go? - Yeah!

286
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,770
wait, I have something to do on Saturday

287
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,260
Oh yeah, the play

288
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,430
live, live

289
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,430
Die

290
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,730
live, live, live live

291
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,730
Die

292
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,720
hey, what happened to the

293
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,190
judicial system presided over by a tribunal of wise elders

294
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,940
I had 'em lined up and shot

295
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,020
- You know son, maybe you've been spent to much - Silence! Seize him

296
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:37,540
All right son, I think it's time you goose-stepped off to bed

297
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,830
you're embarrassing me in front of my men

298
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,650
Hal
Hal!

299
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,130
Why is this still here?

300
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,160
No fair! You did without me?!

301
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,550
Spangler's coming lose the plant

302
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,860
Time has come, we'll drawn the line

303
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,540
This is our Alamo

304
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,400
It's a bad example but you know what I mean

305
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Attention

306
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,630
This is more like it

307
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:50,430
Everything shipshape the commanding officer enters

308
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,550
and is greeted by straightened backs

309
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,160
And cracker of shoe leather

310
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,170
Now I know it's been a rough couple of days

311
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,500
but we'll agree we are the better for it

312
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,810
We are a leaning meaning learning machine

313
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,920
Now I know that some of you think I'm a sadist

314
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,140
but some day you'll thank me

315
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,910
Man, that's brutal

316
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,490
Is there anything we can do to cheer you up?

317
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,410
Do you have more pictures of your sister?

318
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,920
I give him curses, yet he gives me love

319
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,140
Hal, please stop. You're making it worse

320
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,760
You okay, sport

321
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,510
Why are we here? Malcolm betrayed us

322
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,270
if you love something, let it go

323
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,520
save your cat poster philosophy for someone else

324
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,700
We're taking

325
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,010
the highroad

326
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,470
But you were totally scamming together

327
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,660
No. We were just smacking

328
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,630
She claims she was just "hanging out" with Andrew at the party

329
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,620
but they were really hooking up.

330
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,570
I can not believe she would

331
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,540
Enough. Hold, or cut both strings

332
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,670
Was that my cue? Quick, lower me.

333
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,930
This must be one of those times when it feels like an eternity

334
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,610
but only a few seconds have gone by.

335
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,870
How com Malcolm didn't say anything in 5 minutes?

336
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,190
Line

337
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,530
Normally I would enjoy something like that but this is just sad

338
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,770
How now, spirit? Wither wander you?

339
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,740
How now, spirit? Wither wander you?

340
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,310
The King doth keep his revels here tonight.

341
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,370
The King doth keep his revels here tonight.

342
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:30,670
So, good night unto you all.Give me your hands if we be friends

343
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,910
and Robin shall restore amends.

344
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:42,410
It's over? You promised a partial nudity

345
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,620
Yeah that was a lie

346
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,590
And ice cream after?

347
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
that too

348
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,620
How now, spirit? Wither wander you?

349
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,270
The King doth keep his revels here tonight.

350
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,830
I knew I knew it!
