这小太阳花帮不上什么忙的
You can't get us all the troubles with this little sunny use

225
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,010
它不是阻碍 它是一种反抗
This isn't a stunt. This is an act of violence

226
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,240
它只是棵草
It's a plant!

227
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,890
你看不出吗 这不是关于植物

他就知道他摧毁不了我们的意志 永远不会

231
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,860
这不值得冒险
It's not worth the risk

232
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,980
又一次证明 看来我是这里唯一的男人

我不敢相信Nicole穿着那裙子 
I can't believe Nicole wearing dress like that

234
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,660
可以看到她的乳头 如果她想变荡妇 可以

237
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,420
但是因为David和Brenda的事 她肯定没机会
But the way he's off in Brenda's business she didn't have a chance

238
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,520
不敢相信我们的对话这么深入
I can't believe how deep our conversations are getting

239
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,250
你肯定不信我听到Josh什么了 不要告诉别人
You never gonna believe what I heard about Josh. But you can't tell anyone

240
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,450
我无意中在厕所
I overheard his stepsister

241
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,330
听到他的非亲生妹妹 他的亲生妹妹还是非亲生
When I was in the bathroom - His half sister or step sister

242
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,640
他的非亲生妹妹 这样他才能爱上他
No, his step sister. That's why he can  have a crush on her

243
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,520
- 她们在说我 对吧  - 不 我们在说Josh
- They were just talking about me weren't they? - No, we are talking about Josh

244
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,010
他爸爸抓到他和妹妹
Oh my god! His father like totally went down

在浴缸里后彻底抓狂了
after catching him in the hot tub with his step sister

246
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,740
但是我觉得他不知道整个故事
but you know what I don't even think he knows the whole story

247
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,670
到我了
That's my cue

248
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,620
我感觉抛弃天才少年享乐很罪恶
I feel guilty having so much fun and at ditching the Krelboynes

249
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,520
但是我肯定他们也很开心
but I'm sure they are doing fun without me

250
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,140
你们很幸运没人报警
You boys just lucky no one call the police

251
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,510
你不能证明我们火箭爆炸和
You can't prove there's any correlation between our rocket exploding

304
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,400
这个比喻不恰当 你应该明白我的意思
It's a bad example but you know what I mean

305

立正

00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,630
这才像样
This is more like it

307
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:50,430
一切都井然有序

314
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,140
但总有一天你们会感谢我
but some day you'll thank me

315
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,910
兄弟 刚才太残忍了
Man, that's brutal

316

还有你妹妹的照片吗
Do you have more pictures of your sister?

318
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,920
我给他诅咒 他却给我爱
I give him curses, yet he gives me love

319
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,140
住手Hal 你越弄越糟
Hal, please stop. You're making it worse

儿子你还好吗
You okay, sport

321
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,510
为什么来这儿 Malcolm背叛了我们
Why are we here? Malcolm betrayed us

322
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,270
如果你爱一个人 就不要计较这么多
if you love something, let it go

323
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,520
省省你的伪哲学吧
save your cat poster philosophy for someone else

324
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,700
我们要
We're taking

325
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,010
采取极端方法
the highroad

326
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,470
你们只是相互欺骗
But you were totally scamming together

327
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,660
不 我们只是暧昧
No. We were just smacking

328
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,630
她说她只是和Andrew在派对上玩玩
She claims she was just "hanging out" with Andrew at the party

329
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,620
但是他们真的搞在一起
but they were really hooking up.

330
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,570
我不敢相信她竟然
I can not believe she would

331
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,540
够了 握住或者丢弃
Enough. Hold, or cut both strings

332
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,670
到我了吗 快把我放下去
Was that my cue? Quick, lower me.

333
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,930
这应该就是那些只有几秒钟 
This must be one of those times when it feels like an eternity

334
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,610
却像一辈子的时候

335
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,870
为啥Malcolm五分钟没有说话了
How com Malcolm didn't say anything in 5 minutes?

337
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,530
我会很享受这种情况 但这太惨了
Normally I would enjoy something like that but this is just sad
