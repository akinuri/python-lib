1
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,450
Where did you come from, flubber?

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,620
"Hello, Hal."

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,830
I'm so full of bacon, my body's meant for shakin'

4
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,790
And when I start to wiggle, my nipples, they will jiggle

5
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,660
Once again I have to be embarrassed for the both of us. Yep!

6
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,050
You go straight for your job after school today.

7
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,550
I don't want you to be late for your first day of work. And no excuses!

8
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,230
I don't wanna hear, "A lion escaped from the zoo",

9
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,140
or, "The bus driver went insane and refused to stop."

10
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,470
Francis's friend gave Reese a job at the Circus Burger.

11
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,540
It's perfect.

12
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,490
Reese gets to be bossed around all day

13
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,960
by the only guy on the planet that's dumber than he is.

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,880
- This job is stupid! - You do get to wear a paper hat.

15
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,760
Reese, you wanna drive when you get your license,

16
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,370
you have to pay your own insurance!

17
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,940
Yeah, but everyone else has insurance! Why do I need it?

18
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,250
They've got it covered.

19
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,130
Son, it's not as simple as that. You see...

20
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,840
Good morning, everybody! Say good morning, Charlie.

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,720
Show everyone how alive you are.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,840
My parents made a deal with Dewey.

23
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,180
If he keeps his goldfish alive for two months, he gets a dog.

24
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,930
- Am I doing a good job? - You sure are.

25
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,340
- How is that fish still alive? - I don't know

26
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,640
He never feeds it and he leaves it out in the sun for hours.

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,650
Last week there was an old banana peel in there!

28
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,430
I do not want a dog in this house!

29
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,990
As long as the fish is alive, there is nothing we can do about it.

30
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,220
Hal, I expect you to take care of this.

31
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,690
- What are you suggesting? - I'm not suggesting anything.

32
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,000
I just want it taken care of.

33
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,390
Class, today we begin a new round of independent study projects.

34
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,150
Hydrostatic equilibrium?

35
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,660
My God, I am still my Path integral quantisation

36
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,480
My stepdad's right,I'm useless.

37
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,880
Well, the cold, hard fact of life

38
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,360
is some are more advanced than others.

39
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,550
Some even think they're more advanced than me.

40
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,840
I never said that.

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,030
Yet you assume I'm talking about you.

42
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,690
You're looking right at me!

43
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,920
I'm sure you're all convinced by virtue of you being in this class,

44
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,960
your intellects tower above those of

45
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,690
tiny plebeians wasting oxygen in the rest of the school.

46
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,540
But, to some, you are nothing more

47
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,080
than howling primates.

48
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,880
I'm excited to announce today

49
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,550
that we're welcoming to our class a new student.

50
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,010
A young man of unparalleled intellect.

51
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,330
As near as we can measure, his IQ is over 280.

52
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,790
Those tests are culturally biased!

53
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,610
Think what you will.

54
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,200
Your petty fears no longer concern me.

55
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,190
I finally have the mental clay worthy of my sculpting.

56
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,250
Barton is a white-hot comet of brilliance,

57
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,520
blazing through our dark little corner of ignorance.

58
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,740
A mind of such unfathomable reach

59
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,230
- and enormous power. - Can I come in now?

60
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,290
Barton, I thought I told you to wait till you heard,

61
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,440
"A new era for man."

62
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,940
But there's a bee out there.

63
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,990
So, assistant manager. How's that happen?

64
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,040
INS raid, Quendus out.

65
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,960
So, from 12 to 5, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday,

66
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,260
this is my domain.

67
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,840
I'm proof you don't need to graduate high school.

68
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,070
That's just propaganda

69
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,320
from those money-grabbing diploma companies.

70
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,560
Sean, Doug, this is Reese.

71
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,280
- Hey. what's up? - Hey.

72
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,140
OK. Press cow for burger, potato for fries.

73
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,110
And I'm not sure what this is.

74
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,350
Does that look like a pig or a dog to you?

75
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,200
Wouldn't it be easier to put words on the keys?

76
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,370
Ah, a man of letters.

77
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,070
A word to the wise.

78
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,170
I wouldn't throw that in anyone's face.

79
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,380
Once you get your total, you put the money in the drawer,

80
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,370
except you are making a pocket transactions. What's that?

81
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,560
Kind of a morale builder.

82
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,630
Once in a while take 5 or 10 bucks.

83
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,410
but you don't ring it up, put it in your pocket instead.

84
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,750
You don't have a problem with that, do you?

85
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,820
Oh, no. That's cool.

86
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,160
See, Reese. You've entered the working world.

87
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,730
A world of adult responsibility.

88
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,890
I have the key to her locker.

89
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,480
If you wanna smell her jacket later, just let me know.

90
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,720
Hey, they found the last piece of that guy.

91
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,140
Oh, man!

92
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,960
Come on, guys. We talked about this.

93
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,590
If we're gonna share a roll of toilet paper,

94
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,440
can we at least keep it on the spindle?

95
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,300
As long as you are bringing this kinda of stuff up,

96
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,690
I got a fiancee coming Thursday.

97
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,550
Fiancee? What are you taking about? I'm engaged.

98
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,120
It comes to time when a man gets tired of playing the field.

99
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,270
What field? You don't even know any women.

100
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,590
That occurred to me, too,

101
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,320
That's why I ordered one from Russia.

102
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,220
A mail-order bride? That actually exists?

103
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,490
Sure. In some of the more irradiated parts of former Soviet Union,

104
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,420
there are a lot of marriage-minded women.

105
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,940
That's my darling Svetlana.

106
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,260
Wait a second. Yep.

107
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,600
Svetlana.

108
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,180
How come you're driving us to school?

109
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,620
Because that's what moms do sometimes.

110
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,380
Argh!

111
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,150
OK, you know your Tolstoy and your Eliot...

112
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,650
Let's see how you do with the Bard.

113
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,650
"Every true man's apparel fits your thief."

114
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,870
Measure For Measure, Act 4, Scene 2.

115
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,270
Elbow says to Pompey.

116
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,620
Could you hand me my green crayon?

117
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,420
- Wow, he's right again. -  OK, Barton

118
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,510
let's try Chaucer's The Shipman's Tale.

119
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:31,810
- Should I start with the prologue? - Please. How about line 203?

120
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,120
"And when your husband has gone off to Flanders,"

121
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,820
"I shall deliver you from fear of slanders,"

122
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,240
"and on the word he caught her by the flanks"

123
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,460
"and clasped her closely, giving her a riot of kisses,"

124
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,010
"saying softly, 'Keep things quiet'"

125
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,640
What are you doing?

126
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,030
Chaucer? I cannot believe you're polluting his mind

127
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,340
with such pop culture drivel!

128
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,930
I apologise for them, Barton.

129
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,570
I'll do everything I can to minimise these annoying distractions

130
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,190
so that you can concentrate on the accelerated programme

131
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,650
I've laid out for you.

132
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,990
Together we are gonna astonish the world.

133
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,800
Would you like a pixy stix?

134
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,030
Thank you.

135
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,250
Having problems, Malcolm?

136
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,400
No, no, not you

137
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,840
It's the stupid hydrostatic equilibrium. It doesn't make sense!

138
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,010
It is awfully difficult. But don't despair.

139
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:29,920
I'm here for you, Malcom.

140
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,580
I'll make sure you get the help you deserve.

141
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,150
To estimate the pressure at the centre of the sun,

142
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,690
just assume a constant density of 1.41 grams per cubic cm.

143
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,610
Am I going too fast for you?

144
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,290
You know, Herkabe only made you my tutor to humiliate me.

145
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,030
I thought it was to humiliate me.

146
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,840
I don't understand why is this so hard?!

147
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,130
Don't give up. Remember The Little Engine That Could?

148
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,510
You're not listening!

149
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,120
I get everything!

150
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,250
In my entire life, there is nothing I haven't been able to master.

151
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,020
I took algebra in 6th grade!

152
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,560
I taught my dad how to rebuilt his transmission when I was five!

153
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,470
I was reading before I could walk!

154
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,230
I remember my own birth. What?!

155
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,960
D'you know your heart stops during your mother's contractions?

156
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,610
You seriously remember that?

157
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,480
Worst was the diaper changing.

158
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,980
That was the most degrading week of my life.

159
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,860
So, what's it like in there?

160
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,820
What do you mean?

161
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,020
Well, your brain?

162
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,660
I mean, for me it's like, when I'm thinking really hard,

163
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,760
my brain starts making all these connections.

164
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,670
Those connections make other connections,

165
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,940
Everything starts to moving really fast.

166
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,060
Then it feels like a bomb's going off.

167
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,730
Is yours like that?

168
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,450
It's more like a beehive.

169
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,120
And every bee has a brain like yours.

170
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,860
OK, ready!

171
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,650
That is so cool!

172
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,500
I wish you had a gun

173
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,160
so we can really test this out.

174
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,520
Excuse me. Can I get some help here?

175
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,530
Hi, Greg.

176
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,880
So I overheard your mom talking on the phone

177
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,890
and it's true. You've got a job.

178
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,800
I applied here once. Didn't get it.

179
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,740
- It's all politics. - I guess.

180
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,140
- So what do you want? - I want you to listen very carefully.

181
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,700
My blood sugar's dangerously low

182
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,250
so I don't wanna burn up calories repeating myself.

183
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,360
I want the jumbo clown burger with big top fries,

184
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,490
no pickles, a slice of onion, make sure it's centre cut,

185
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,910
and extra tomatoes.

186
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,840
And let's do the pattie well on one side, medium on the other.

187
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,280
Make sure they open a fresh package for my bun.

188
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,840
If it's stale I bail.

189
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,830
Seriously.

190
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,820
Your total's $5.45 and you get free refills on the soda.

191
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,420
Heard that one before. Turns out it's just for today.

192
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,960
What a sack!

193
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,900
That's a pocket transaction if I ever saw one.

194
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,430
Oh, yeah. Right.

195
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,100
Artie, you put together one hell of a bachelor party.

196
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,560
I'm much obliged to you.

197
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,100
I'm just sorry the nearest stripper's 300 miles away.

198
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,240
Hey, how's she doin' anyway?

199
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,320
She took her top off!

200
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,380
Oh, yeah!

201
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,330
Listen up! I'd like to say a few words about my mate Pete,

202
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,240
on account of his upcoming nuptials.

203
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,620
Many's the time, when I've been feeling low,

204
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,290
and I always knew I could turn to Pete.

205
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,870
He'd be lying on his bunk, trimming his beard with a lighter,

206
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,740
and I'd think, "Hell, I'm better than that."

207
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,600
To Pete and his lucky lady!

208
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,010
What's going on with you?

209
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,620
I just don't get what are we celebrating?

210
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,060
I mean, it just seems wrong.

211
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,840
It's Pete's life.

212
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,080
If he wants to marry a total stranger, that's his business.

213
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,490
What about this woman? Is anyone thinking about her?

214
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,920
Right now I'm trying to keep a topless stripper in my head.

215
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,620
I don't have room for much else.

216
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,900
Think about it for a second.

217
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,010
She's blindly committing

218
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,680
to spend her life in this god forsaking place

219
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,350
with Pete as her husband.

220
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,710
What kind of poor creature would actually go through with this?

221
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,230
Maybe her life's pretty awful.

222
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,420
Worse than this?

223
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,190
What? Does she live in a slaughterhouse?

224
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,180
Is she dragged to work by horses every day?

225
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,340
She couldn't possibly know what she's getting into.

226
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,990
You're exaggerating. We don't know.

227
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,460
It might work out fine.

228
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,060
Dude, how's business?

229
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,340
Where were you? I was supposed to be home for dinner

230
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,240
but you are the only one who can cash me out.

231
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,520
Hey, I'd stay on my good side if I was you.

232
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,890
One of these days somebody'll have to clean these bathrooms.

233
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,320
Whoa, this is way uncool.

234
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
Reese, you can't take this much money.

235
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,200
What are you talking about?

236
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,250
Your cash drawer, man.. It is over $400 bucks short. Look.

237
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,520
The whole point is to take five or ten bucks. That's it.

238
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,250
You got to put the 400 back.

239
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,680
I didn't take it. Honest.

240
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,130
Dude. It's your register.

241
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,510
- Did he give his register key to anyone today? - No.

242
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,560
I didn't take it. I didn't take any.

243
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,340
I never even do one of those stupid pocket transactions.

244
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,560
What do you talking about? I saw you yesterday.

245
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,470
No, I wanted it to look like I was taking it. But I didn't really.

246
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,450
When you guys weren't looking I put the money back.

247
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,200
You guys didn't see it cos I was being... sneaky and stuff.

248
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,130
Nice, Reese.

249
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,790
- Way to screw it up for everybody. - I didn't take it!

250
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,450
Look, man. If you are thinking that I'm coverin' for you, you are crazy.

251
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,500
When the owner comes back tomorrow morning and checks the books,

252
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,280
that money better be herel, or you're going down.

253
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,860
Alright. The change from apparent to absolute magnitude in all spectra

254
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,130
The formula is...

255
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:35,230
A over B times K over D. That's if K is...

256
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,110
How do they expect you to learn all these formulas?

257
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,670
Use a mnemonic device,

258
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,880
like Enephru, Babashar, Kalar, Dastrer.

259
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,620
Babylonian kings, Third Dynasty.

260
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,970
Stop complaining. I have homework, too.

261
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,710
Ah, it's a butterfly.

262
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,280
Malcolm, you got to help me.

263
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,260
- What's goin' on? - It's horrible.

264
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,750
There is $400 missing from my register during my shift,

265
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,010
and they think I took it.

266
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,850
- Well, did you? - No, of course not!

267
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,770
- I'm Barton. - Who's this dork?

268
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,570
- He is my tutor. - You're kiddin' me!

269
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,230
The one time I need you to be a genius

270
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,240
I find you've been faking the whole smart thing.

271
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,220
Reese, calm down. How did this happen?

272
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,010
I don't know.

273
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,560
My register didn't total up right at the end of the shift.

274
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,940
- Who was there? - Everyone.

275
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,930
Me, Sean, Greta, Richie.

276
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,250
Richie? Why didn't you say so at the first place?

277
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,220
What do you mean?

278
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,040
It's Richie. He's setting you up.

279
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,770
How do you know?

280
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,160
Because it's Richie! C'mon!

281
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,120
Barton, you wanna learn something about the real world?

282
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,380
- Not really. - Too bad.

283
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,300
You're coming.

284
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,060
Dewey, you have to cover it for us.

285
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,790
Make sure it sounds like we're all still here.

286
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,960
Got it.

287
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,250
Ow! Stop it!

288
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,820
You shut up!

289
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,200
Stupid creeps!

290
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,920
Ow! Stop it!

291
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,510
- Did you get it? - Yes, I got it.

292
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,870
Pet store owner told me it was already dead,

293
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,390
but I suspect the worst.

294
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,300
OK. Let's switch the fish tonight when Dewey's sleeping.

295
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,770
I don't know, Lois. It seems so sneaky and underhanded.

296
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,800
What kind of example are we setting for the boys?

297
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,250
Well, Hal, stop worrying.

298
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,550
The boys are fine.

299
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,360
Hey dude, did you get the money?

300
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,690
Yeah, you'd like another 400, wouldn't you?

301
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,680
What are you talking about?

302
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,300
Wow! An entire colony of parasitica.

303
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,920
Get your own pizza, Dewey.

304
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,060
His name's not Dewey.

305
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,180
How come you had me call him that all these years?

306
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,940
Look. We know you took the money

307
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,620
and you're trying to pin it on Reese.

308
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,510
After everything my brother's done for you!

309
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,440
All the alibis, all the handouts,

310
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,380
- all the times he's helped you fake your death! - Whoa! Dudes!

311
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,970
I wasn't even there today.

312
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,400
The only time I came in was to cash out.

313
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,110
You were right there.

314
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,490
Yeah, but I had a ten-minute break at 4:30.

315
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,510
You could have snuck in then and take the money.

316
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,930
- Yeah, but... - You wanna play innocent?

317
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,900
Fine. We'll just let the police decide.

318
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,740
Whoa, police.!

319
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,350
What makes you think the cops are gonna take your side?

320
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,240
Maybe cos you've been arrested like 10 times for petty theft.

321
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,820
Excuse me, one of those was for arson.

322
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,780
I am telling you, you're making a big mistake.

323
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,330
- No, I'm not! - Yes, you are!

324
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,460
- No, I'm not! - Yes, you are.

325
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,280
He didn't do it. According to this citation,

326
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,880
Richie was stopped at 4:20 at 18th and Wilson

327
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,040
for urinating from a moving vehicle.

328
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,050
- So? - So the Circus Burger is on Walnut,

329
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,160
which is at least 25 miles away.

330
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,120
He couldn't have got there during Reese's break.

331
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,380
Well what if the traffic was light..

332
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,200
Yeah. And maybe if a '78 Bonneville could go 300 miles an hour.

333
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,110
Otherwise, it's impossible.

334
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,070
Hey, way to go, Dewey!

335
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,060
- Let me see that. - Is he right?

336
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,400
Yes. He's always right.

337
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,360
Sorry, Richie. Come on, Reese, let's go.

338
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,110
But I swear to God, I didn't do it. I didn't take the money!

339
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,530
Well, look. We still have a few hours.

340
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,180
Maybe we can figure...

341
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,050
Richie, I got us this DVD player

342
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,990
but we need to steal another 600

343
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,090
if you want the surround...

344
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,780
..sound.

345
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,310
You may wanna hang on to that receipt.

346
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,150
I can't believe you lied!

347
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,360
We are calling the cops!

348
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,420
Hey-ey-ey. Maybe we could figure out some sort of a deal?

349
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,110
Whatever you guys want, it's yours.

350
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,490
We get to use your place for a party any time we want.

351
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,770
Yeah, and we get free burgers for life.

352
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,320
I get to make out with your girlfriend.

353
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,680
Forget it!

354
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,430
Alright, the bean bag chair.

355
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,340
Wow! Pete, is that really you?

356
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,180
No, it's a reflection.

357
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,000
Here. You can give these to Svetlana.

358
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,230
Eric and Artie should be back any minute with your bride.

359
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,420
I gotta to be honest, I'm er... I'm a little nervous.

360
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,220
You are about to marry a total stranger.

361
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,170
Have you really thought about what you're doing?

362
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,650
I've been thinking about settling down for a long long time.

363
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,860
But you don't know anything about her.

364
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,240
What if she thinks you're...

365
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,130
What if she doesn't like you?

366
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,840
I'd be sad

367
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,420
but I'd reassure her I'd support her anyway,

368
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,240
cos I made that commitment.

369
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:08,430
Then I guess I'd spend the rest of my life being sweet to her.

370
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,130
And also changing her mind.

371
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,280
- Well, good luck, Pete. - Thanks.

372
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,520
Svetlana's here, and she is gorgeous!

373
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,370
I must've misread the catalogue.

374
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,830
Just look how light on her feet she is.

375
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,200
- Hey, baby. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

376
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,510
Hey, guys.

377
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:42,760
Oh, hey, Pete...

378
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,230
Just get that thing out of here!

379
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,300
- I'll take care of it. - I got it.

380
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,440
- Why you? Cos I signed for it!

381
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,060
Who cares if you signed for it? Wait a minute.

382
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,690
That's our ride.

383
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,670
How nice of Richie to drive you to school.

384
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,900
Yeah, well, that's just his way of saying, "thanks for a job well done."

385
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,720
Good morning, everybody.

386
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,120
Now, son, don't be disappointed...

387
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,550
Say good morning, Charlie.

388
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,460
Show everyone how alive you are!

389
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,500
Aren't I doing a good job?

390
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,660
Yeah, yeah. Great.

391
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,190
That little monster!

392
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,880
He's been buying his own fish and switchin' 'em!

393
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,120
God only knows how many he's gone through.

394
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,780
- He's gonna pay for this! - How?

395
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,120
If we bust him, he'll know we've been cheating, too.

396
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,980
Dewey, your father and I are so proud of

397
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,830
the way you've taken care of that fish.

398
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,950
Yes, we are. You certainly proved to us you can be trusted.

399
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,070
It's so nice to have a boy

400
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,370
who's so conscientious, responsible

401
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,070
and honest and who always finds a way to do the right thing.

402
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,860
Before we go any further, is there anything you wanna tell me?

403
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,310
I want a beagle!

404
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,920
You're not gonna get it, you little sneak!

405
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,080
We know that you've been switching fish on us,

406
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,360
and that's because I put a dead fish in there last night!

407
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,390
That's cheating! You're cheaters!

408
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:28,400
It's not exactly textbook

409
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,240
but at least we're not getting a dog.

410
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,020
I cleaned out my cubby.

411
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,770
You're sure I can't talk you into staying?

412
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,990
Mom says I need a healthier environment.

413
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,420
She thinks it's creepy the way you're using me

414
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,280
for your own self-grandiosement.

415
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,340
A healthier environment? That's not what you need.

416
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,790
Son, you'll never connect normally with another human being.

417
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,830
People will recognise your brilliance and loathe you for it.

418
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,750
The best you can hope for is uncomprehending fear

419
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,080
which I can channel into great things.

420
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,690
- Please? - Can I go now?

421
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,360
Sure. Go.

422
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,320
You, my ex-wife,

423
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,950
all of my therapists, you're all the same.

424
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,570
Bye, guys.

425
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,340
Bye, Barton.

426
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,370
Good luck at NASA.

427
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,540
Send us a letter when you get declassified.

428
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,960
Mr Herkabe, we know this is hard for you, so...

429
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,570
It's his dad.

430
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,280
We photo-shopped your head in.
